## Description
This document will describe the procedure for writing a tutorial blog post.

## Problems/Reason for document
* Having no structure to my posts makes them very inconsistent.
* When there is no structure to follow posts generally end up as just a blob of incomplete information that is difficult to follow.
* With no set goals, motivation to complete the post is low.

## Goals
* All future tutorial blog posts to follow the same format.
* More precise & targeted documentation.

## Perquisites
* Access to GitHub pages
* Jekyll site setup
